## Project Description

The Recipe Search App is a user-friendly application that allows users to search for recipes using an API. The app fetches data based on the user's input and displays the searched meals with their available picture, the name of the dish, the category and country it belongs to, the ingredients, and the instructions for making them. The app also handles errors gracefully, providing feedback when a dish is not found or if there is another error.

## Features

- Search for recipes by ingredient, meal name, or category.
- Display meal details including picture, name, category, country of origin, ingredients, and instructions.
- Handle errors and provide user feedback if a dish is not found or if there is an error.
